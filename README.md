# Title
Voting-based reward distribution system

# Motivation
We want to find a transparent, decentralized system allowing students to review lectures and reward teachers. 

# Explanation
In eg. a portion of PBA funds can be allocated onto smart-contract. Each student can be assigned to student list based on the People Chain polkadot address. Students can vote for each module from 1 to 10. When certain amount of students vote, the money is relased from the smart-contract to the teachers. Each teacher is rewarded proportionally to the rating for their module: (total_money / number_of_modules) * rating. The remaining money stays on the contract (burns) 

# Conclusion
System allows only students to vote and reward teachers. The teachers are motivated to do the best classes. The money is sent proportionally to the review and the remaining money is burnt. It prevents from the teachers race (taking the most money from the chain), gives transparency and defines the upfront rules.
